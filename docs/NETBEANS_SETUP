These are the steps required to setup netbeans and the frc plugins on 
a linux ubuntu 12.04 machine.


First make sure you have internet connection.


1) Install dependencies:

   $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk ia32-libs



2) Install netbeans.  Google for netbeans ubuntu.  Most likely it is at
   https://netbeans.org/downloads/.   Download Java SE.  This should put a
   shell script (.sh file) in your Downloads folder.  Run this by typing

   $ sh netbeans-7.4-javase-linux.sh

   or whatever version you have.   Follow the installer.  If the jdk installation
   worked, there should be no problems here.



3) Install the FRC netbeans plugins.  You can google for this to find the exact link.
   In netbeans, go to Tools->Plugins, click on the settings tab and click Add.  Type
   in 'FRC Plugins' or similar for name, then use this link for the url
   'http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/java/netbeans/update/Release/updates.xml'  Note this may
   change in the future, so if installation doesn't work, use different url.
 
   Then click on Available Plugins tab and scroll down and you should see 6 FRC plugins.
   If you don't, you may have entered the wrong link.  Highlight them all and say install.
   You'll have to restart.



4) Configure using your team.  Go to Tools->Options.  Select the Miscellanious tab, then the
   FRC Configuration tab.  Put 4750 in the team name and say ok.


You should be good to go!
